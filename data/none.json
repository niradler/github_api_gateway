 - [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with a link to the PR (not the Issue)\r\n  - [x] Rebased/mergable\r\n  - [x] Tests pass\r\n  - [x] Sign [CLA](https://influxdata.com/community/cla/) (if not already signed)\r\n\r\nConnect #2749 \r\n\r\n### The Problem\r\n- Delete / Edit buttons do not follow the *appear on hover* pattern seen in other tables\r\n- TICKscripts do not follow the *click name to edit* pattern seen in the rules table\r\n- Alert Rules do not show in TICKscripts table even though they are technically TICKscripts beneath the surface\r\n- Delete buttons do not require confirmation\r\n- The name of the page in the page header does not match the side nav\r\n- Unclear what the difference between TICKscripts and Alert Rules is\r\n\r\n### The Solution\r\n- Delete buttons only appear on row hover and require confirmation\r\n- Removed the `Edit TICKscript` button from both tables\r\n- TICKscript names are links that take you to the editor (matches pattern found in Alert Rules table)\r\n- TICkscripts table shows both Alert Rules and TICKscripts (although it shows the `name` instead of `id` for Alert Rules\r\n  - This modifies the UX such that if the user wants to edit an Alert Rule as a TICKscript they must locate it in the TICKscripts list and click the name there\r\n- TICKscripts are color coded green because all things Kapacitor are usually green\r\n- Changed the name of the page to `Manage Alerts` in both the page header and sidenav\r\n- Should be more clear that all Alert Rules are TICKscripts but not all TICKscripts are Alert Rules\r\n- Will be more straightforward to selectively show each table based on permissions\r\n- Improved the column widths and removed monotype text\r\n\r\n### Preview\r\n![screen shot 2018-02-20 at 2 04 08
